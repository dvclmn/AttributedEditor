This is less about Markdown anatomy, and more about
expressing rendering intent. E.g. this doesn't list out
leading and trailing syntax; because as far as visual styles
go, both should be styled the same.

- Cross-language rendering role taxonomy

Could reuse this for:
- Swift (keyword, identifier, punctuation → syntax/content split)
- JSON (keys vs values)
- HTML (tag syntax vs text content)
- Markdown (emphasis markers vs text)

Note: `background` shouldn’t be a role, it’s more a decoration
Have removed for now.

Role answers: what is this range?
Token answers: how should it look?
